Welcome to SPC-EyePi

This project allows you to do timeseries photography from your
DSLR camera on the Raspberry-PI or other Linux boards with
probably not a lot of changes.

Once photo's are taken they are then uploaded to a central
server of your choice via sftp or ftp.

It automatically detects connected usb DSLRs and the raspberry pi camera (just duplicate "example.ini" to "picam.ini" and "eyepi.ini").

This is also the pulling repo for the spc-eyepi component of SPC-OS.
